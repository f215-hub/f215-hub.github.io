My Timeline: July 2024 – October 2024
Tips
1.	Personalize your learning approach 
Although studying each word of the Learning Systems can feel overwhelmed and tedious, you can always customize the order of materials and start from your most comfortable and interested topic first. From this method you can boost your confidence and motivation as you progress. For example, you can begin with demand or supply and later combine both when you studying Sales & Operation Planning. 

Here are my steps studying Learning System:
a.	After roughly going through all the modules and topics, I started from Module 1 Section B to D, which is about demand management. It is the most relevant topic to my work.
b.	Then I reached to the production planning section since I am also familiar with production topics.
c.	Without much background in SRM and CRM, I learned them from scratch and dedicated more time understanding.
d.	Connected all other topics together, including risk management, sustainability, and logistics. Finally established my own knowledge database.

2.	It is a good practice to referring to exam manual and APICS Dictionary for key words and points review. Exam content manual (ECM) covers most of the content in the exam. The ECM includes:
a.	References 
b.	Content Outline
c.	Key Terminology
d.	Sample Questions
3.	Every diagram is useful 
There are plenty of diagrams and pictures in Learning System. Visualization is a helpful technique for me to memorize and understand complex concepts.

4.	Test yourself with quizzes
After each section, it is super important to test yourself using Learning System Quizzes.  Although some of questions are frustrated and extremely detail-focused, trust me, they worth your time and are the best ways for you to comprehend the materials. 

5.	Supplement your study with IMM
It is normal if you cannot find answers in the Learning System. Therefore, Introduction of Material Management (IMM) 8th edition is your sweet learning company, where you can find step-by-step calculations or rationales behind questions. It is also a book recommended by APICS organization for various examinations, including CPIM.

6.	Power of spaced repetition
Don’t overlook the power of repetition, especially in the final two weeks before exam. Review the Learning Systems and quizzes multiple times (I reviewed them five times) to reinforce the key concepts and diagrams.  was able to draw nearly every important diagrams. 

7.	Additional resources 
Finally, if more time is available, there are lots of learning resources and mock questions online, such as Pocket Prep. I personally like it since explanations are very helpful and the team is responsive. They even have subject experts to answer your questions. You can choose these additional tools wisely according to your own learning and review paces.

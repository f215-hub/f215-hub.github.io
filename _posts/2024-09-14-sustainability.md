According to McKinsey research, 49% Gen Z consumers are now willing to pay more for sustainable products. Obviously, sustainability is getting more buy-ins. It not only influences downstream customers but also guides business’s directions. In this article, I will expand on sustainability’s impacts on future global supply chains from three perspectives. 

Companies and customers are interconnected by the supply chain. Compared with traditional linear flows, the circular supply chain or role interchangeability is more credible for sustainability. A materials supplier can also consciously become a customer for recycled products for the same company. For example, a coffeehouse supplies the coffee grounds to a manufacturer who can recycle to make eco-friendly straws and cups. These recycled sets are then supplied to the same coffeehouse for a complete and sustainable resource loop. Although this basic circular economy may need more processing standards and cost optimization, this undoubtedly minimizes the total resource flow within the supply chain and urges innovations.

“There is no business to be done on a dead planet”. The depletion of natural resources impels upstream suppliers and each party on the chain pondering resource sustainability. How to efficiently use resources to their maximum potential and recycle waste have determined the survivability of global supply chain. For example, in pursuit of “carbon neutrality”, China is leading the global race of EV batteries manufacturing and innovation; but, together, battery recycling poses a challenge for the whole chain. Should we still encourage endlessly unsustainable growth and consumption? And there is money spent endlessly on recycling waste rather than addressing its true causes of, for example, overproduction. Carmakers now are applying the 5R (reduce, reuse, recovery, recycling, remanufacture) concept for future material reutilization. In the future, appropriate technologies like Blockchain and IoT will empower each company’s reverse logistics to take responsibility for products from birth to rebirth.

Finally, relationship sustainability is usually ignored when talking about supply chain metrics. This usually includes initiating and encouraging internal retraining, reallocation, and strategic alliance with external partners. This can be easily overlooked since the high profit and social sustainability are usually considered as diametrically opposed trade-offs. However, if managed well, companies will gain more from a stable relationship than direct layoffs. Costco perfectly exemplifies that a company can achieve financial success and labor sustainability at the same time. In 2022, its employee turnover rate is only 8%, and over a third of the workers have been there for more than ten years. This has also motivated Costco’s SRM to develop close and long-term partnerships with suppliers, churn out high-quality Kirkland signature products, and ultimately nurture mutual commitment to improve supply chain resiliency.

As Yvon Chouinard said in this book, “What we take, how and what we make, what we waste, is in fact a question of ethics.” In conclusion, a sustainable supply chain thrive by being both responsive to the customers’ needs and be responsible for educating society, where it should not be filled with infinite growth nor with disposable businesses.
